    <string name="txt_help_description">Timed Solo Deck Mode\n\nIn the \"Timed Solo Deck\" mode, any pair of cards
        in the deck will have exactly one image in common. Your task is to find the matching image on the draw card (bottom)
        as fast as possible.\n\nTo select an image, tap that image on the card.\n\nIf you\'ve tapped the matching
        image on the draw card, good job! The game will then advance by moving the draw pile card to the discard pile and
        then revealing a new card in the draw pile. The game will continue until no cards are left.\n\nIf
        you\'re quick, you just might get a high score!
        \n\nWords and Images Mode
        \n\nThe \"Words and Images\" mode plays like \"Timed Solo Deck\", but pictures may be
        replaced by a word describing them. Each card will have at least one word and last least one image. Any cards with words
        replacing pictures will remain with the same words throughout the game. Note that in order to find a match between two cards
        you may have to match two pictures, two words, or a picture and its associated word!
        \n\nFlickr Functionality
        \n\nNote that you can select "Flickr" as an image set! Click "Options" > "Flickr Photos" to turn on Flickr, allowing you to
        search its database and get images to use in the game by clicking on the \"+\" button on the top right! You can select from the
        already shown images by clicking on them to download them, or you can use the magnifying glass to trying searching up photos associated to
        what you type in the nearby search bar!
        \n\nOne you press the back button, you will see your collection of downloaded photos. Click on any of them to remove them from your set. You can
        also undo this by tapping on the image (which would now be represented by a placeholder image)!

    <string name="txt_body_tips">Tip #1: To change your player name so that it shows up in your next
        high score, go to the Options screen and enter your name into the entry box.\n\nTip #2: For some visual
        variety, head to the Options screen where you can change the deck theme. This will change which images will appear on cards in future games.
