There are several steps to be followed to find the exported deck photos in an Android Emulator.
These are taken from Mithilesh Izardar and Forge @: https://stackoverflow.com/a/38736733

1. Go to settings
2. Click On Storage & USB
3. Click On Internal Storage
4. Scroll Down the bottom and click Explore
5. The exported deck pictures will be in the "Pictures" Folder that appears in the choices of
folders to open.

6. Go to Settings and give the Gallery app permission to Storage Access
7. If the picture still doesn't appear in the Gallery App at this point (this happened to me when I
followed all previous steps right after clicking the Export Photos button), there should be an
option to setup the Emulator's SD card in the notifications bar. IF you haven't done the set up, do
so and then unmount and mount the SDcard at Settings -> Storage
